# Escape Room

### Create an interactive program, complete with GUI, which simulates and Escape Room. An Escape Room is a one-room scenario where the player must find items scattered or hidden around the room in order to leave it.

## Requirements

* Must contain appropriate use of Methods
* Must contain appropriate use of Decision Structures
* Must contain appropriate use of GUI Components
* Options must change based on user actions. For example, a door that won't open unless the player has a key
* Must contain at least 2 nodes. A node is a location in the room, like the bed, dresser and door in my example. 
* NO POP-UPS!!! (unless it makes sense to do so, which is typically a warning)

## Expectations

Whether your Escape Room gets completed is not a requirement. You don't have to race to finish. However, I need to see the above requirements, with the number of nodes being flexible. 

If you are able to get one node working in the two weeks and have demonstrated methods, if-statements and proper GUI, you might still earn full credit depending on the content. 

In other words, just do the best you can, get something working and TURN IT IN! Some points are better than no points at all. Besides, if yor REALLY work hard, you may surprise yourself on what you can do.
